cosine similarity

Cosine Similarity (d1, d2) =  Dot product(d1, d2) / ||d1|| * ||d2||

Dot product (d1,d2) = d1[0] * d2[0] + d1[1] * d2[1] * â€¦ * d1[n] * d2[n]
||d1|| = square root(d1[0]2 + d1[1]2 + ... + d1[n]2)
||d2|| = square root(d2[0]2 + d2[1]2 + ... + d2[n]2)

if the 2 matrices does not have similar size, add 0 to remaining one.
Hence, Dot product(testdoc, Document1) 
     = ((0.5) * (0.1) + (0.5)*(0.1))
     = 0.1

||testdoc|| = sqrt((0.5)2 + (0.5)2) = 0.707106781

||Document1|| = sqrt((0.1)2 + (0.14)2) = 0.141421356

Cosine Similarity(Query, Document) = 0.1 / (0.707106781) * (0.141421356)
                                        = 0.1 / 0.1
                                        = 1


find testdoc cosine similarity in Document 2 and Document 3
arrange in descening order. if the value is 1 => perfect match and 0 means no match
